# mcpypanel
One of the best open-source panel for a minecraft Server / Proxy, writen with python.
Admins, Servers owners or teens wanting simply a minecraft server: This is one of your best friends!

You can easily control everything on a server / group of server (proxy).

It is being coded with a linux machine.

It is not working for the moment. (I'm actively coding this masterpiece)

This, if I manage to get it working, it could be really useful for everyone, from just people who want a server to big server owner, with all this features. 

You want more infos, or request a feature: open an issue with, as a title, your request. 


For the list of planned features and features that are already in, please take a look at [TODO.md](TODO.md)
