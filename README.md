# mcpypanel
One of the best open-source panel for a minecraft Server / Proxy, writen with python.
Admins, Servers owners or teens wanting simply a minecraft server: This is one of your best friends!

You can easily control *everything* on a server / group of server (proxy).

It is being coded with a linux machine.

It is not working for the moment. (I'm actively coding this masterpiece)

This, if I manage to get it working, could be really useful for everyone, from just people who want a server to big server owner, with all of the features.
