# mcpypanel
Just a panel for a minecraft Server / Proxy, writen with python.
It is being coded with a linux machine.

It is not working for the moment.

This, if I manage to get it working, it could be really useful for everyone, from just people who want a server to big server owner, with all this features. 

You want more infos, or request a feature: open an issue with, as a title, your request. 


For the list of planned features and features that are already in, please take a look at [TODO.md](TODO.md)
